## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devpilot.git
cd devpilot
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in both `client` and `server` directories:

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_app_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_app_secret
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
EC2_SSH_KEY_PATH=/path/to/your/key.pem
```

### 4. Run the development servers

```bash
# Run backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Run frontend
cd ../client
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🧩 Deployment with Bash Script

You can deploy any app directly using the included deployment script:

```bash
./deploy_app.sh <github_repo_url> <directory_name>
```

This script will:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (npm/yarn/pnpm)
3. Start the app using PM2
